# Library search algorithm

## Overview
This project was something I worked on the side on in highschool. I was experiementing with searching and displaying results. 
i.e. understanding the basics of what someone might want their first searh result to be, is it: the number of matching words? Author? Relatedness of genre? I try to address these aspects in my project.

## Functionality
This program will take the books.txt file with the author, genre, and book title and deposit them in a library matrix. When someone wants to take out a book they must enter the book id which can be displayed by searching for the book.
 The search engine can search by author, genre, and book title. When searching, the program returns the books in a list ordered from most matching characters to least. When someone wants to take out a book the program will give them a date for when it is due.
 When a book is returned, the user is prompted for a date and the late fee will be calculated likewise.
